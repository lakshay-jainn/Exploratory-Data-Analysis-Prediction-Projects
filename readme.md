# Exploratory Data Analysis & Prediction Projects by Lakshay Jain

This repository contains three end-to-end data analysis and prediction projects.
Each project focuses on extracting insights through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and predictive modeling.
The emphasis is not just on accuracy, but also clear visualization and business-focused insights.
