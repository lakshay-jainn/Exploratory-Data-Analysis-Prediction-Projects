# Exploratory Data Analysis & Prediction Projects by Lakshay jain

This repository contains two end-to-end data analysis and prediction projects.  
Both focus on extracting insights through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and predictive modeling.  
The projects emphasize not just accuracy, but also clear visualization and business-focused insights.

## ðŸ“‚ Projects

### 1. Bank Marketing Subscription Prediction
- **Dataset:** ~750,000 records (including **704,789 synthetically generated from real values**).  
- **Objective:** Predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit.  
- **Highlights:**
  - Performed preprocessing, categorical grouping, and feature engineering.  
  - Analyzed demographic, financial, and behavioral patterns influencing subscriptions.  
  - Built classification models, achieving **90.6% accuracy on cross-validation**.  
- **Skills/Tools:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Repo:** [Bank Marketing Project](https://github.com/lakshay-jainn/Binary-Classification-with-a-Bank-Dataset)

### 2. Titanic Survival Prediction
- **Dataset:** Titanic passenger dataset (~891 rows).  
- **Objective:** Predict passenger survival based on demographics and travel features.  
- **Highlights:**
  - Conducted EDA to uncover survival patterns (age, class, gender).  
  - Applied feature engineering to improve model performance.  
  - Built classification models, achieving **83% accuracy on Cross validation**.  
- **Skills/Tools:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Repo:** [Titanic Project](https://github.com/lakshay-jainn/titanic-dataset-analysis)

## ðŸ”Ž Key Learnings
- Handling both small datasets (hundreds of rows) and large-scale datasets (750k+ rows).  
- Managing **synthetic vs real data distributions** in analysis.  
- Extracting actionable business insights from EDA.  
- Building classification models with interpretable results.
